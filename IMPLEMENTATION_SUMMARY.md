# Implementation Summary: Admin Panel and Music Library Scanning

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive admin panel to the music streaming platform, enabling administrators to manage the music library and automatically import songs from a local folder.

## Features Implemented

### Backend Features
1. **Admin Controller** (`AdminController.java`)
   - RESTful endpoints for song CRUD operations
   - Library scanning endpoint
   - Statistics endpoint
   - Protected with `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`

2. **Music Library Service** (`MusicLibraryService.java`)
   - Automatic folder scanning for audio files
   - Metadata extraction using jaudiotagger library
   - Support for 10+ audio formats
   - Duplicate detection
   - Automatic artist creation
   - Error handling and reporting

3. **Security Configuration**
   - Admin endpoints require ADMIN role
   - JWT-based authentication enforced
   - Proper role-based access control

4. **Database Updates**
   - Added `findByTitleAndArtist_Name` query method
   - Support for deduplication during import

### Frontend Features
1. **Admin Page** (`Admin.js`)
   - Modern, responsive UI design
   - Song management table with edit/delete actions
   - Modal form for adding/editing songs
   - Library statistics dashboard
   - Scan library button with result display
   - Loading states and error handling

2. **Navigation Updates**

- AIFF/AIF (Audio Interchange File Format)
- ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
- OGG (Ogg Vorbis)
- WMA (Windows Media Audio)

### Configuration
```properties
# Music library path (configurable via environment variable)
music.library.path=${MUSIC_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/runner/music}
music.library.scan-on-startup=false
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
- `org:jaudiotagger:2.0.3` - For audio metadata extraction

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/songs` - List all songs
- `POST /api/admin/songs` - Create new song
- `PUT /api/admin/songs/{id}` - Update song
- `DELETE /api/admin/songs/{id}` - Delete song
- `POST /api/admin/library/scan` - Scan music library
- `GET /api/admin/library/stats` - Get library statistics

### Security
- All admin endpoints protected with ADMIN role requirement
- JWT token validation on every request
- Frontend checks user role for UI visibility
- Backend enforces role-based access control

   - Click "Add Song Manually"
   - Fill in song details
   - Select artist from dropdown
   - Submit form

3. **Import Songs from Folder**
   - Configure `music.library.path` in application.properties
   - Click "Scan Library" button
   - Wait for scan to complete
   - Review results

4. **Manage Existing Songs**
   - Click "Edit" to modify song details
   - Click "Delete" to remove songs
   - View play counts and metadata

### For Developers

1. **Configure Music Library Path**
   ```bash
   export MUSIC_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/your/music
   ```

2. **Create Admin User**
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE username = 'admin';
   ```

3. **Run Application**

## Testing

Comprehensive testing guide available in `TESTING_GUIDE.md` including:
- Manual test cases for all features
- cURL examples for API testing
- Security testing procedures
- Configuration testing scenarios

## Build Status
